            <h1>Adopt an animal and listen to it's heartbeat</h1>

            <p>Help stop the extinction of animals by "adopting" an endangered animal. Your commitment will make a
                difference.</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>

            <p>You create a user account on this page. Choose an animal you want to "adopt". Pay the donation. The money
                goes to improve the livelihood of the animal you have adopted. Once the transaction has been completed,
                you will have access to a set of features on your profile.</p>

            <p>When you adopt an animal, you will be able to follow the animal in real time via our app! Using modern
                satellite technology, the route the animal takes is tracked and displayed in an interactive map on your
                mobile.</p>

            <p>We also have cutting-edge technology that can measure heart rate using a type of heat-seeking cameras on
                the satellites. This heart rate is recorded and displayed in your app along with several other exciting
                features.</p>

            <p>You will receive regular updates on what the money you have donated is used for, as well as how the
                condition is in the habitat where the animal lives.</p>

            <p>If possible, and if we do not unnecessarily disturb the animal, our volunteer corps will take pictures of
                the animal you have adopted and send them to you. </p>

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

            <p>Earth's wildlife is disappearing at a furious pace. In a cynical world, where the animals' livelihoods
                are at the expense of economic profit, mass extinction of endangered species is imminent.</p>

            <p>Anisave is the animals' advocate. Together we can prevent the degradation of the natural areas where the
                animals live and facilitate the best possible living conditions for these animals. </p>
            
            <p>All income we receive will be used to improve the livelihood of the
            animals you adopt, by fighting poachers, preventing deforestation,
            working for more nature reserves, being the animals' spokespersons
            in policymaking, etc. These are important measures to achieve the
            goal of the UN's sustainability goals No. 15 on protecting life on
            land. </p>

            <p id="space">Our app helps to increase the feeling of closeness
                to wild animals and nature in a completely new way, which can
                help to raise awareness about endangered species.</p>
